# Radix Sort in Ruby

By [Philip Q Nguyen](https://github.com/philipqnguyen)

## Description

This algorithm does two main things, it `engroup` numbers into its proper arrays based on its least significant number, and then it `degroup` numbers into a new list and then engroups numbers again. It keeps doing this until the numbers are sorted.
